In my dissertation, I study the antecedents and consequences of issue changes of social movement organizations using quantitive and computational methods.

With Phillip Brandt, Jeremy Kuhnle, and Henning Hillmann, I investigate labor market careers of immigrants in the German labor market.

With Jacob Habinek, I currently investigate how sociologists use theoretical models in the absence of theoretical consensus.

Together with Pavel Dimitrov Chachev, I study collaboration patterns of YouTubers.
