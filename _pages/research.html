<b>Issue Change in Social Movement Organizations</b><br><br>

In my dissertation, I study the antecedents and consequences of issue change in social movement organizations. 
Using data from the Dynamics of Collective Action project, I show that SMOs change what they protest for a variety of reasons and 
that such issue changes have positive effects on their mobilization, coalition-building, and survival. Beyond the organizational level, 
I also demonstrate that issue-changing SMOs contribute to the cohesion and continuity of social movements.<br><br>

<b>Immigrant Careers in German Firms</b><br><br>

In this DFG-funded project together with Philipp Brandt, Jeremy Kuhnle, and Henning Hillman, we study the careers of immigrants in German firms.
Using Linked-Employer-Employee Data (LIAB), we follow the career paths of several thousand immigrants to investigate how they navigate 
firms’ internal labor markets to compensate for existing disadvantages.<br><br>

<b>Social Mechanisms as Trading Zones</b><br><br>

Together with Jacob Habinek, I think and write about what social mechanisms can contribute to theory-building in sociology. Even though they are
not the promised panacea for bridging the explanatory–interpretative divide (or other divides), we argue that social mechanisms can foster the 
emergence of trading zones in which different research cultures learn from one another. Our argument supports an understanding of scientific 
progress that favors theoretical pluralism over general laws and synthesis.<br><br>

<b>Romance Dawn</b><br><br>

In this project with Pavel Dimitrov Chachev, we study the collaboration patterns and success of YouTubers who create content about the famous 
Japanese manga One Piece. (The project title is a homage to the manga’s first story arc.) We investigate this online community to explore how 
such communities can thrive on algorithm-oriented social media platforms that often undermine community-building. Using blockmodeling, network,
and quantitative methods, we show the development of complementary roles in the community that place members in a symbiotic relationship, 
allowing the community to grow.<br><br>
