Hello and welcome! :) I am Marcel, a sociologist and postdoctoral fellow at the Centre de Sociologie des Organisations (CSO) at Sciences Po, Paris. Previously, I worked as a research assistant at the Mannheim Centre for European Social Research (MZES). I hold a doctorate in sociology from the Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences (GESS) at the University of Mannheim.

In my research, I use computational, network, and quantitative methods to study how people and organizations exercise agency to change against existing structures and how they fare as a result. My substantive research projects reach into very diverse corners of the social world: from social movement organizations (SMOs) in the US, to employees in the German labor market, to content creators on YouTube. Across these and other projects, I examine change against structure from processual and relational perspectives, using abductive logic to uncover the mechanisms that shape its antecedents and consequences. In my dissertation project, I studied issue change in SMOs between 1960 and 1995, revealing positive outcomes for the organizations and for social movements at scale. Together with Philipp Brandt, Jeremy Kuhnle, and Henning Hillman, I investigate how native and non-native employees with atypical career paths fare in the German labor market. In the digital realm, I study collaboration patterns and role formation among content creators navigating the incentive structures of algorithm-oriented social media platforms such as YouTube, together with Pavel Dimitrov Chachev. Last but not least, I also think and write with Jacob Habinek about the role of social mechanisms as trading zones in sociological theorizing.

Beyond these specific projects, I have broad interests in economic, organizational, cultural, and cognitive sociology. I also have a taste for abduction, sociological theory, and (neuro-)phenomenology. Our current times have further sparked my interest in philosophy and political theory.

The other pages on this website provide more details on my research and teaching. Thank you for engaging with my work, and please do not hesitate to reach out if you have questions, would like to collaborate, or simply want to discuss any of the topics above. I wish you a pleasant day and good luck with your current and future projects.
