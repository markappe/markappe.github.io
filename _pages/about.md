Hello and welcome! :) I am Marcel, a sociologist and postdoctoral fellow at the Centre de Sociologie des Organisations (CSO) at Sciences Po, Paris. Previously, I worked as a research assistant at the Mannheim Centre for European Social Research (MZES). I hold a doctorate in sociology from the Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences (GESS) at the University of Mannheim.

In my research, I use computational, network, and quantitative methods to study how people and organizations exercise agency to change against existing structures and how they fare as a result. My substantive research projects involve brilliant collaborators and reach into very diverse corners of the social world: from social movement organizations changing their issues, to employees with atypical career paths in the German labor market, to the collaboration patterns and role formation of content creators on YouTube. Beyond these specific projects, I have broad interests in economic, organizational, cultural, and cognitive sociology. I also have a taste for abduction and sociological theory. Our current times have further sparked my interest in philosophy and political theory.

The other pages on this website provide more details on my research and teaching. Thank you for engaging with my work, and please do not hesitate to reach out if you have questions, would like to collaborate, or simply want to discuss any of the topics above. I wish you a pleasant day and good luck with your current and future projects.

Here's my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EemmFgfiwL01jt-ZM0_P_2eZH8NhcRHp/view?usp=drive_link).
